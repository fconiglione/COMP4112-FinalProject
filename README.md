# Data Science (COMP-4112) Final Project

**Worth: 40%**

**Topic Notification Deadline:** November 3rd at the latest by e-mail, include “Data Science Project Topic” in subject  
You will provide me with an overview of what you want to do for some initial feedback. It will be ungraded. If you have decided earlier than this date, please let me know.  

**Due Date:** November 22nd  
In this final project, you will build a machine learning-based classifier or regression model to attempt to solve a significant problem in data science. I have provided some classification datasets for NLP; for those examples you would focus on building classifiers with good performance. For the UCI datasets, or for regression models, you need to decide what type of question/problem you want to answer and ask for my approval before you proceed. You may suggest a topic not listed here. You will develop code in Python/scikit-learn. Following this, you will write a report outlining your methods. Example reports are posted on the course site; I am expecting something around 8 pages. If you would like it to be longer, that is OK.  

**Default approach:**  
The default approach to this project should be CPU-based supervised learning. If you want to do unsupervised, please talk to me first (e-mail or in-person). Deep learning topics may be acceptable, although I do not have GPU resources at this time. The chosen topic should remain within the general scope of the course.  

**Report impact on grade:**  
The information in the report will play a major factor regarding my overall assessment of your deliverables, especially on CSV/TSV datasets with limited pre-processing steps. Be sure you include a good amount of information in the report that provides me with a clear picture of what you did.  

**Some datasets could be more work than others:**  
Some datasets will require more effort to work with than others. I may take this into consideration when assigning your grade. For instance, there will be more effort getting the NLP data I have suggested here pre-processed compared to say working with a dataset from UCI that has all the values you need already.  

**Difficulty and workload:**  
This project is not meant to be overwhelming; you don’t have to do a perfect job on it and I’m here to help. If you don’t end up finishing something, explain how you would have done it in the report; I will consider that as at least a partial “deliverable.” If you didn’t get the accuracy you wanted, again, talk about it in the report or how you could have improved.  

**The report can be formatted however you like, just as the sample reports are.**  
I have posted the ACM and IEEE research conference format as well for anyone interested in potentially doing CS research later.  

**The report format (generally 8 pages) should be as follows:**  

- **Abstract** – 250 words max. Summarize what you did.
- **Introduction** – What information do I need to know/have context about in order to understand what you have tried to do with your project? For instance, with fake news, why do we care about this? For health, why is this important? Why use ML to address this?
- **Methods** – What did you do with the data? How did you process it? What approaches did you take to your classifiers/regression models?
- **Results** – What was the sample size? Did data processing impact the results? How did you address feature selection? How did your models perform?
- **Discussion/Conclusion** – Discuss what went well, and what might have been improved. Did you discover anything particularly interesting?

**Suggested Datasets (Please seek my approval regarding the dataset/problem you want to address):**  

**657 Regression/Classification datasets to choose from:**  
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)  

**NLP preprocessing-based (I approve all of these, but there will be more difficulty to pre-process them. Just let me know which one you are doing)**  
- [Zenodo Record](https://zenodo.org/records/7123483)  
- [COLING-1.167](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.167/)  
- Webis Health CauseNet 2022  
- [Explainable Automated Fact-Checking for Public Health Claims](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/explainable-automated-fact-checking-for)  
- [CLIMATE-FEVER](https://www.sustainablefinance.uzh.ch/en/research/climate-fever.html)  
- [ColBERT](https://github.com/Moradnejad/ColBERT-Using-BERT-Sentence-Embedding-for-Humor-Detection), Humor detection  
- [FNC-1 dataset](http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/), Fake News Detection  

**Numeric datasets suitable for regression (Please seek my approval regarding the dataset/problem you want to address)**  
- [Conditions Contributing to Deaths Involving Coronavirus Disease 2019](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/conditions-contributing-to-deaths-involving-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-by-age-group)

- [Vehicle Dataset from Cardekho](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)  

**Grading:**  
Grading is to an extent, subjective. The instructor will evaluate your report, deliverables, and assign a numeric grade. You could for instance pick data that is harder to work with and produce classifiers that are worse than say someone working with a basic dataset; items such as these will be considered. I have posted three samples that are representative of an A or B range grade.
